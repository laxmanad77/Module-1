Program 1: Addition and Subtraction of Two Numbers
Description:

This Python program prompts the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). It then performs the following operations:

Addition: Adds num1 and num2.

Subtraction: Subtracts num2 from num1.

The results of both operations are displayed to the user. This is a basic arithmetic program that demonstrates how to handle user input and perform simple math operations in Python.

Program 2: Multiplication and Division of Two Numbers
Description:

This Python program asks the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). It then performs the following operations:

Multiplication: Multiplies num1 and num2.

Division: Divides num1 by num2.

The program includes a check to ensure that division by zero is avoided. If num2 is zero, it alerts the user that division is not possible. This program helps demonstrate basic arithmetic and conditional logic in Python.
